= Skupper Hello World




A minimal HTTP application deployed across Kubernetes clusters using Skupper

This example is part of a {examplesLink}[suite of examples] showing the different ways you can use Skupper to connect services across cloud providers, data centers, and edge sites.

.Overview

This example is a very simple multi-service HTTP application deployed across Kubernetes clusters using Skupper.

It contains two services:

* A backend service that exposes an `/api/hello` endpoint.
It returns greetings of the form `Hi, <your-name>.
I am <my-name> (<pod-name>)`.
* A frontend service that sends greetings to the backend and fetches new greetings in response.

With Skupper, you can place the backend in one cluster and the frontend in another and maintain connectivity between the two services without exposing the backend to the public internet.



Prerequisites

* The `kubectl` command-line tool, version 1.15 or later (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[installation guide])
* Access to at least one Kubernetes cluster, from https://skupper.io/start/kubernetes.html[any provider you choose]

.Procedure
--

. Install the Skupper command-line tool
+
--

This example uses the Skupper command-line tool to deploy Skupper.
You need to install the `skupper` command only once for each development environment.

[,shell]
----
sudo dnf install skupper-cli
----






--

. Set up your clusters
+
--

Skupper is designed for use with multiple Kubernetes clusters.
The `skupper` and `kubectl` commands use your https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/[kubeconfig] and current context to select the cluster and namespace where they operate.

Your kubeconfig is stored in a file in your home directory.
The `skupper` and `kubectl` commands use the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to locate it.

A single kubeconfig supports only one active context per user.
Since you will be using multiple contexts at once in this exercise, you need to create distinct kubeconfigs.

For each namespace, open a new terminal window.
In each terminal, set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to a different path and log in to your cluster.
Then create the namespace you wish to use and set the namespace on your current context.

NOTE: The login procedure varies by provider.

*West:*

[,shell]
----
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-west
# Enter your provider-specific login command
kubectl create namespace west
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace west
----

*East:*

[,shell]
----
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-east
# Enter your provider-specific login command
kubectl create namespace east
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace east
----

--

. Deploy the frontend and backend
+
--

This example runs the frontend and the backend in separate Kubernetes namespaces, on different clusters.

Use `kubectl create deployment` to deploy the frontend in West and the backend in East.

*West:*

[,shell]
----
kubectl create deployment frontend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-frontend
----

*East:*

[,shell]
----
kubectl create deployment backend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-backend --replicas 3
----

--

. Create your sites
+
--

A Skupper site is a location where components of your application are running.
Sites are linked together to form a network for your application.
In Kubernetes, a site is associated with a namespace.

For each namespace, use `skupper init` to create a site.
This deploys the Skupper router and controller.
Then use `skupper status` to see the outcome.



*West:*

[,shell]
----
skupper init
skupper status
----

Sample output:

[,console]
----
$ skupper init
Waiting for LoadBalancer IP or hostname...
Waiting for status...
Skupper is now installed in namespace 'west'.  Use 'skupper status' to get more information.

$ skupper status
Skupper is enabled for namespace "west". It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
----

*East:*

[,shell]
----
skupper init
skupper status
----

Sample output:

[,console]
----
$ skupper init
Waiting for LoadBalancer IP or hostname...
Waiting for status...
Skupper is now installed in namespace 'east'.  Use 'skupper status' to get more information.

$ skupper status
Skupper is enabled for namespace "east". It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
----

As you move through the steps below, you can use `skupper status` at any time to check your progress.

--

. Link your sites
+
--

A Skupper link is a channel for communication between two sites.
Links serve as a transport for application connections and requests.

Creating a link requires use of two `skupper` commands in conjunction, `skupper token create` and `skupper link create`.

The `skupper token create` command generates a secret token that signifies permission to create a link.
The token also carries the link details.
Then, in a remote site, The `skupper link create` command uses the token to create a link to the site that generated it.

NOTE: The link token is truly a secret.
Anyone who has the token can link to your site.
Make sure that only those you trust have access to it.

First, use `skupper token create` in West to generate the token.
Then, use `skupper link create` in East to link the sites.

*West:*

[,shell]
----
skupper token create ~/secret.token
----

Sample output:

[,console]
----
$ skupper token create ~/secret.token
Token written to ~/secret.token
----

*East:*

[,shell]
----
skupper link create ~/secret.token
----

Sample output:

[,console]
----
$ skupper link create ~/secret.token
Site configured to link to https://10.105.193.154:8081/ed9c37f6-d78a-11ec-a8c7-04421a4c5042 (name=link1)
Check the status of the link using 'skupper link status'.
----

If your terminal sessions are on different machines, you may need to use `scp` or a similar tool to transfer the token securely.
By default, tokens expire after a single use or 15 minutes after creation.

--

. Expose the backend
+
--

We now have our sites linked to form a Skupper network, but no services are exposed on it.
Skupper uses the `skupper expose` command to select a service from one site for exposure in all the linked sites.

Use `skupper expose` to expose the backend service in East to the frontend in West.

*East:*

[,shell]
----
skupper expose deployment/backend --port 8080
----

Sample output:

[,console]
----
$ skupper expose deployment/backend --port 8080
deployment backend exposed as backend
----

--

. Access the frontend
+
--

In order to use and test the application, we need external access to the frontend.

Use `kubectl port-forward` to make the frontend available at `localhost:8080`.

*West:*

[,shell]
----
kubectl port-forward deployment/frontend 8080:8080
----

You can now access the web interface by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
