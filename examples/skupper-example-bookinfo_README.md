# Distributing Bookinfo services across clusters with Skupper

This tutorial demonstrates how to distribute 
[Istio Bookinfo Application](https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo/)
microservices across multiple public and private clusters.
The services require no coding changes to work in
the distributed application environment. With Skupper the application
behaves as if all the services are running in the same cluster.

This example further illustrates how services in a
public cluster may access services in a private cluster when the private cluster 
will not accept incoming network connections and the private cluster 
has no ingress routes. 
Skupper infrastructure securely provides this connectivity and it does so
without special user permissions, firewall rules, VPNs, sidecars, or system administrator
actions.

In this tutorial you will deploy 
the _productpage_ and _ratings_ services on a remote, public cluster
in namespace `aws-eu-west`
and
the _details_ and _reviews_ services in a local, on-premises cluster in namespace `laptop`.

## Overview

##### Figure 1 - Bookinfo service deployment

<img src="graphics/skupper-example-bookinfo-deployment.gif" width="640"/>

Figure 1 shows how the services will be deployed.

* Each cluster runs two of the application services.

* An ingress route to the _productpage_ service provides internet user
access to the application.

If all the services were installed on the public cluster then the application
would work as originally designed. However, since two of the services are on
the _laptop_ cluster the application fails. _productpage_ can not send requests
to _details_ or to _reviews_.

This demo will show how Skupper can solve the connectivity problem presented
by this arrangement of service deployments.

Figure 2 shows how the clusters appear after Skupper has been set up.

Skupper is a distributed system with installations running
in one or more clusters or namespaces. Connected Skupper installations share
information about what services each installation exposes. Each Skupper installation learns 
which
services are exposed on every other installation. Skupper then runs proxy service endpoints
in each namespace to properly route requests to or from every exposed service.

* In the public namespace the _details_ and _reviews_ proxies intercept requests for their 
services and forward them to the Skupper
network.

* In the private namespace the _details_ and _reviews_ proxies receive requests from the
Skupper network and send them to the related service. 

* In the private namespace the _ratings_ proxy intercepts requests for its service and 
forwards them to the Skupper network.

* In the public namespace the _ratings_ 
proxy receives requests from the Skupper network and sends them to the related service.

## Prerequisites

To run this tutorial you will need:

* The `kubectl` command-line tool, version 1.15 or later ([installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/))
* The `skupper` command-line tool, the latest version ([installation guide](https://skupper.io/start/index.html#step-1-install-the-skupper-command-line-tool-in-your-environment))
* The `oc` command-line tool, if using OKD for your public cluster ([installation guide](https://docs.okd.io/1.5/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#installing-the-cli))
* Two Kubernetes namespaces, from any providers you choose, on any clusters you choose
* The yaml files from https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-example-bookinfo.git
* Two logged-in console terminals, one for each cluster or namespace
* If you are using `minikube` as your public cluster, run `$ minikube tunnel` in a separate terminal

## Step 1: Deploy the Bookinfo application

This step creates a service and a deployment for each of the four Bookinfo microservices.

Namespace `aws-eu-west`:

    $ kubectl apply -f public-cloud.yaml
    service/productpage created
    deployment.extensions/productpage-v1 created
    service/ratings created
    deployment.extensions/ratings-v1 created

Namespace `laptop`:

    $ kubectl apply -f private-cloud.yaml 
    service/details created
    deployment.extensions/details-v1 created
    service/reviews created
    deployment.extensions/reviews-v3 created

## Step 2: Expose the public productpage service

Namespace `aws-eu-west`:

    $ kubectl expose deployment/productpage-v1 --port 9080 --type LoadBalancer

The Bookinfo application is accessed from the public internet through this ingress port to the _productpage_ service.

If you are running your public cluster namespace `aws-eu-west` on OKD,
then you might need to create a route:

    $ oc create route edge productpage --service=productpage

## Step 3: Observe that the application does not work

The web address for the Bookinfo application can be discovered from 
namespace `aws-eu-west`: 

    $ echo $(kubectl get service/productpage -o jsonpath='http://{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}:9080')

***If you are running a minikube cluster, then use:***

    $ echo $(kubectl get service/productpage -o jsonpath='http://{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}:9080')

***If you are running an OKD cluster, then use:***

    $ echo $(oc get route/productpage -o jsonpath='https://{.status.ingress[0].host}')

Open the address in a web browser. _Productpage_ responds but the page will show errors because the
services in namespace `laptop` are not reachable.

Let's fix that now.

## Step 4: Set up Skupper

This step initializes the Skupper environment on each cluster.

Namespace `laptop`:

    $ skupper init

Namespace `aws-eu-west`:

    $ skupper init

Now the Skupper infrastructure is running. 
Use `skupper status` in each console terminal to see that Skupper is
available.

    $ skupper status
    Skupper is enabled for namespace '"<ns>" in interior mode'. It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.

As you move through the steps that follow, you can use `skupper
status` at any time to check your progress.

## Step 5: Connect your Skupper installations

Now you need to connect your namespaces with a Skupper connection. 
This is a two step process. 

* The ```skupper token create <file>``` command directs Skupper 
to generate a secret token file 
with certificates that grant 
permission to other Skupper instances to connect to this Skupper's network. 

    Note: Protect this file as you would 
          any file that holds login credentials.

* The ```skupper link create <file>``` command directs Skupper to connect to
another Skupper's network. This step completes the Skupper connection.

Note that in this arrangement the Skupper instances join to form peer networks.
Typically the Skupper opening the network port will be on the public cluster.
A cluster running on `laptop` may not even have an address that is reachable from
the internet. After the connection is made the Skupper network members are peers
and it does not matter which Skupper opened the network port and which connected to it. 

The console terminals in this demo are run by the same user on the same host.
This makes the token file in the ${HOME} directory available to both terminals.
If your terminals are on different machines then you may need to
use `scp` or a similar tool to transfer the token file to the system
hosting the `laptop` terminal.

### Generate a Skupper network connection token

Namespace `aws-eu-west`:
 
    $ skupper token create ${HOME}/PVT-to-PUB-connection-token.yaml
    
### Open a Skupper connection

Namespace `laptop`:

    $ skupper link create ${HOME}/PVT-to-PUB-connection-token.yaml

### Check the connection

Namespace `aws-eu-west`:

    $ skupper status
    Skupper is enabled for namespace '"aws-eu-west" in interior mode'. It is connected to 1 other site. It has no exposed service.

Namespace `laptop`:

    $ skupper status
    Skupper is enabled for namespace '"laptop" in interior mode'. It is connected to 1 other site. It has no exposed service.

## Step 6: Virtualize the services you want shared

You now have a Skupper network capable of multi-cluster communication 
but no services are associated with it. This step uses the ```kubectl annotate``` 
command to notify Skupper that a service is to be included in the Skupper network.

Skupper uses the annotation as the indication that a service must be virtualized.
The service that receives the annotation is the physical target for network requests
and the proxies that Skupper deploys in the other namespaces are the virtual targets
for network requests. The Skupper infrastructure then routes requests between the 
virtual services and the target service.

Namespace `aws-eu-west`:

    $ kubectl annotate service ratings skupper.io/proxy=http
    service/ratings annotated

Namespace `laptop`:

    $ kubectl annotate service details skupper.io/proxy=http
    service/details annotated
    
    $ kubectl annotate service reviews skupper.io/proxy=http
    service/reviews annotated

Alternatively, Skupper command `expose` can be used as well:

Namespace `aws-eu-west`:

    $ skupper expose service ratings --address ratings --protocol http
    service ratings exposed as ratings

Namespace `laptop`:

    $ skupper expose service details --address details --protocol http
    service details exposed as details

    $ skupper expose service reviews --address reviews --protocol http
    service reviews exposed as reviews

Skupper is now making the annotated services available to every namespace in the Skupper
network. The Bookinfo application will work because the _productpage_ service
on the public cluster has access to the _details_ and _reviews_ services on
the private cluster and because the _reviews_ service on the private cluster
has access to the _ratings_ service on the public cluster.

## Step 7: Observe that the application works

The web address for the Bookinfo app can be discovered from 
namespace `aws-eu-west`: 

    $ echo $(kubectl get service/productpage -o jsonpath='http://{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}:9080')

***If you are running a minikube cluster, then use:***

    $ echo $(kubectl get service/productpage -o jsonpath='http://{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}:9080')

***If you are running an OKD cluster, then use:***

    $ echo $(oc get route/productpage -o jsonpath='https://{.status.ingress[0].host}')

Open the address in a web browser. The application now works with no errors. 

## Clean up

Skupper and the Bookinfo services may be removed from the clusters.

Namespace `aws-eu-west`:

    skupper delete
    kubectl delete -f public-cloud.yaml

Namespace `laptop`:

    skupper delete
    kubectl delete -f private-cloud.yaml
